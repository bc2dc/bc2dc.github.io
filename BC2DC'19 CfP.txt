BC2DC’19: Bridging from Concepts to Data and Computation for eScienceAn eScience 2019 workshop, September 24, San Diego, CA, USA=============================================================================More information: https://bc2dc.github.io Submission page: https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=bc2dc -----------------------------------------------------------------------------Research addressing global challenges federates a growing diversity ofdisciplines, requires sustained contributions from many autonomousorganizations and builds on heterogeneous evolving computationalplatforms. Scientific knowledge is scattered across cloud-basedservices, local storage, and in source code targeting specificarchitectures and computational contexts. Concepts reflected indisparate sources are hardly computer-communicable andcomputer-actionable across or even within disciplines. This makestraceability, communication of methods, provenance gathering andreusing data and methods harder and more time-consuming.To deal with these challenges and to help researchers make better andtransparent use of diverse infrastructures many systems proposehigher-level abstraction to hide and orchestrate infrastructural andimplementation details. Domain experts need to directly controlsophisticated and dynamic concepts pertaining to data, executioncontexts and diverse e-infrastructures. Furthermore, they needmechanisms that allow them to take responsibility for the quality ofresults, without distracting technological artefacts. These often takethe form of service-based platforms, containerised solutions, APIs,ontological descriptions of underlying resources, provenancerepositories, etc. This workshop focuses on platform-driven anddomain-specific developments that contribute towards unifyingunderlying platforms, clouds, data, computational resources andconcepts in order to empower research developers to deliver, maintainand communicate larger, increasingly complex eScience systems.In particular we welcome contributions in the following areas, notexcluding other topics of interest:● Semantic concept description and implementation● Specification and execution of conceptually formulated methods● Component descriptions facilitating reliable composition● Architectures, frameworks and design patterns delivering flexible  use and incremental composition● Cloud, fog, edge and specialized platforms● Pervasive and persistent provenance● Platforms of platforms, containers, orchestration and microservices● HPC computing over CloudSubmission information----------------------We welcome:● full lengths articles (8 to 10 pages),● short articles (4-8 pages), and● extended abstracts (1-2 pages)The proceedings of the workshop will be included in the eScience 2019proceedings to be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press, USAand made available online through the IEEE Digital Library.Timeline--------July 10 2019:	BC2DC'19 Submissions dueJuly 24 2019:	BC2DC'19 Notification of acceptanceJuly 24 2019:	Preliminary BC2DC'19 Programme w/ keynote speakersJuly 29 2019:	Camera-ready papers due for accepted papersOrganizers----------Iraklis A.
