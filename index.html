	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	How can we enable e-Science developers to conceptualize research and translate it to system requirements?<br/>
How should we make such processes understandable, reliable, stable and sustainable? <br/>
How should advances in engineering deliver the expanding power of distributed computation, heterogeneous (cloud and data) platforms and the massive – still rapidly growing – wealth of data?</br>
How can we make it easier for organizations and researchers to engage in multiple research collaborations and to adapt rapidly to changing requirements and new opportunities?
</p>

<p>
Research addressing global challenges federates a growing diversity of disciplines, requires sustained contributions from many autonomous organizations and builds on heterogeneous evolving computational platforms. Scientific knowledge is scattered across cloud-based services, local storage, and in source code targeting specific architectures and computational contexts. Concepts reflected in disparate sources are hardly computer-communicable and computer-actionable across or even within disciplines. This makes traceability, communication of methods, provenance gathering and reusing data and methods harder and more time-consuming. Agile response to new needs and opportunities may be accelerated when the available methods and required components have mutually comprehensible descriptions. Commercial clouds play an increasingly important role in large-scale scientific experimentation. Examples of diversity in technology and jurisdiction, as well as in the large-scale exploitation of clouds can be found on both sides of the Atlantic: in the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) as well as in the ongoing massive migration of data and other resources onto Amazon’s AWS by NASA.
</p>

<p>
It follows that while potential for large-scale data-driven experimentation increases, so does complexity as well as the risk of getting locked into vendor-specific solutions. To deal with these challenges and to help researchers make better and transparent use of diverse infrastructures many systems propose higher-level abstraction to hide and orchestrate infrastructural and implementation details. Domain experts need to directly control sophisticated and dynamic concepts pertaining to data, execution contexts and diverse e-infrastructures. Furthermore, they need mechanisms that allow them to take responsibility for the quality of results, without distracting technological artefacts.
</p>


<p>	
These often take the form of service-based platforms, containerised solutions, APIs, ontological descriptions of underlying resources, provenance repositories, etc. This workshop will focus on platform-driven and domain-specific developments that contribute towards unifying underlying platforms, clouds, data, computational resources and concepts in order to empower research developers to deliver, maintain and communicate larger, increasingly complex eScience systems.
</p>

<p>
In particular we will welcome contributions in the following areas, not excluding other topics of interest:
<ul>
	<li>Semantic concept description and implementation </li>
	<li>Specification and execution of conceptually formulated methods</li>
	<li>Component descriptions facilitating reliable composition</li>
	<li>Architectures, frameworks and design patterns delivering flexible use and incremental composition</li>
	<li>Cloud, fog, edge and specialized platforms</li>
	<li>Pervasive and persistent provenance </li>
	<li>Platforms of platforms, containers, orchestration and microservices</li>
	<li>HPC computing over Cloud</li>
</ul>
